<h3 style="background-color:dodgerblue;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="background-color:orange;"></p>Hi, I am a sophomore here at Lewis and my Major is in business administration.
    I have recently decided to pursue that major, mainly becuase I do not have a clear
    idea on what I want to do when I graduate and I believe that will give me plenty of 
    options. I am the oldest of three siblings, my brother is a senior in highschool and my sister is a freshman.
    My mom is a physical therapist and my dad actually works at Lewis as the Associate Vice President for Facilities.
    I really enjoy it here at Lewis all of my professors have been great and I feel I have taken something away from each class
    that will help me in the future.

<h3 style="background-color:dodgerblue;">My Favorite Hobby</h3>
<p style="background-color:orange;"></p>I have a few hobbies but if I had to choose one
    it would be weightlifting. Without a doubt it is 
    my favorite form of exercise and I really enjoy the struggles
    and challenges. I always like the experimentation when writing my training block
    and trying new things to see what works. It is something I hope to in to old age.
